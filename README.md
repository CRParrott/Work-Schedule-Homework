Work Day Scheduler, Third Party APIs homework

I was able to finish building the Jumbotron with current date, built the workday schedule with times displayed, a text entry input, and a save button.

Javascript is built to display the proper date in the jumbotron, I still need to get the background colors to change as time goes through and save the task entry to the cache then give an option to clear the task when finished.
